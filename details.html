        <h1>Kikoru Shinomiya</h1>

        <h2> Role </h2>
        <p> Kikoru Shinomiya is a highly skilled defense force officer. She takes on a main protagonist role early in
            the show, and often assists other main charcters. She is known for her high unleashed combat power, which
            puts her at nearly the same level as high ranking defense force leaders. She is holds honor and pride, as
            well as a strong, outgoing personality.</p>

        <h2> Universe </h2>
        <p> Kikoru Shinomiya is part of a universe where Kaiju terrorize the world. Kaiju are monsters that often take a
            gigantic form and terrorize nations. Within the universe of "Kaiju No. 8", these kaiju can take on
            specialized forms and mimic human speech and become strong enough to wipe out cities within seconds. The
            defense force is a band of specialized people who are able to fight and often kill these kaiju. The released
            combat power is what determines whether someone is able to take on kaiju or not. They use a suit called a
            combat suit which amplifies strength, speed, and resistance to injury. Kikoru is a special case
            where her initial unleased combat power was 46%. This is extremely high for a rookie officer. This is what
            puts her above all other rookies within the defense force. </p>

        <h2> A Little Bit About Kikoru</h2>
        <p> Kikoru is the daughter of the director of the defense force. From a young age she was determined to be as
            strong as both her mom and dad. When her mom died on the battle field, it only pushed her harder to train
            and become the best of the best. She is not only able to achieve this, but she does so in a way that catches
            the attention of everyone. Within the first season she gets her own specialized weapon, which is usually
            only given to high rank officers. Her personality is bright and outgoing. She keeps herself positive and
            motivates those around her to also do better. She develops a strong friendship with another important
            character, Kafka, and helps him throughout the show. I believe Kikoru to be a positive model of how women
            can be just as strong and just as outstanding as men. </p>
